# Why I decided to open this project
Initially I didn't intend to open source the project directly, I invited the friend who provided me with the license to the repository, he sent the source code to his friend to build and dropped it on the server, it was discovered by ArayKal and then and decompiled to restore the source code and sell it, but I feel sad that the project was completely decompiled by my friend and I and took 5 days to do so, only to be lost by He took it and leaked it, so I decided to open source the project so they don't make money. I am sorry to the author of Karhu, this project was leaked because of me, and I will do my best to make up for my mistake by supporting and sponsoring your project.
